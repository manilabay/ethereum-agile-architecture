# ethereum-agile-architecture
Repo to support Ethereum with more Agile Architecture References Diagrams, essentially sub-graphs showing abstracts and detailed aspects from viewpoints: business, technology, application and data architecture domains.

It is approached to focus in agile architecture(using [graphviz+dot](https://githumb.com/manilabay/dot-graphviz-aws)) rather than styles and formats.

Main and end to end official Ethereum Architecture you can get [here](http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/ethereum-clients/cpp-ethereum/architecture.html?highlight=architecture).
