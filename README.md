# ethereum-agile-architecture
Repo to support Ethereum with more Agile Architecture References Diagrams, essentially sub-graphs showing abstracts and detailed aspects from viewpoints: social/business, technology, application and data architecture domains.

It is approached to focus in agile architecture(using [graphviz+dot](https://githumb.com/manilabay/dot-graphviz-aws)) rather than styles and formats.

For an End-2-End official Ethereum Technical Architecture you can go [here](http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/ethereum-clients/cpp-ethereum/architecture.html?highlight=architecture).

Following diagrams will include end-to-end label when it is a detailed diagram and abstract label when it isn't.

## Ethereum Social/Business Architecture (abstract)

## Ethereum Client Application Architecture (abstract)
